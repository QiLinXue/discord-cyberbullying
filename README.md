**Python discord bot** that aims to use machine learning to detect and remove cyberbullying messages such as hate speech. I aim to implement natural language processing (NLP) so it doesn't just loop through a list of banned words, but actually tries to understand it.

*Will* be documented eventually. Currently a work in progress.
